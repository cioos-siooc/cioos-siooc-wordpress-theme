# cioos-siooc-wordpress-theme
Wordpress theme for the CIOOS-SIOOC website

Dependencie(s)
------------------
- .wpress file provided before
- Experon PRO theme

Installation
------------
Same installation process as any theme on WordPress. You need to go in **Appearance** -> **Themes** -> **Add New** -> **Upload Theme** and upload the .zip file. After that, activate it.

Alternatively the contents of the archive can be placed directly in the wp-content/themes folder on your webhost.

### **Note**
The .wpress file is not necessary but is a must have. You could install Experon Pro + CIOOS theme and do all the configurations by yourself but if you have the .wpress file and you import it first, all the configurations will already be there so it's faster than doing it all by hand.

### **Warning**
You may encounter some interface bugs at the menu level and the suddenly non-existing pre-header for example. We are still investigating on why it's happening but there's an easy way to get around this. You need to go in **Appearance** -> **Menus** -> **Manage Locations** and put back the right menus with the right locations.
